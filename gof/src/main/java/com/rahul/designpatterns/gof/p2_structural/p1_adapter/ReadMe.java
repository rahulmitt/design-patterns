/*
    USECASE:
        There is an existing object that provides the functinality that client needs.
        But, the client cannot use this object because it expects an object with a different interface

    Adapters make existing objects with with the client by adapting the object to client's expected interface
    This design pattern is also called WRAPPER as it wraps an existing object

    Examples in JDK:
        The java.io.InputStreamReader and java.io.OutputStreamReader are examples of object adapters
        They adapt existing inputStream/outputStream objects to reader/writer interface
